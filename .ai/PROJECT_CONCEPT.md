# HealthyMeal Application (MVP)

### Main Problem
Adapting available online recipes to personal needs and dietary requirements is problematic. The application uses AI and user preferences to suggest tailored recipes.

### Minimum Feature Set
- Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting recipes in text form
- Simple user account system to link users with their own recipes
- User profile page for saving dietary preferences
- AI integration enabling recipe modification according to user dietary preferences

### What is NOT in MVP Scope
- Recipe import from URL
- Rich multimedia support (e.g., recipe photos)
- Sharing recipes with other users
- Social features

### Success Criteria
- 90% of users have completed dietary preferences section in their profile
- 75% of users generate one or more recipes per week
