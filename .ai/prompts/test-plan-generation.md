You will be generating a comprehensive test plan for a software project. Here is the project information:

<project_requirements>
@prd.md
</project_requirements>

<tech_stack>
@tech_stack.md
</tech_stack>

Your task is to create a detailed test plan that incorporates the provided tech stack. The test plan should be tailored to the specific project and should explicitly reference the technologies being used.

A comprehensive test plan should include the following sections:

1. **Test Objectives**: Define what the testing aims to achieve for this project
2. **Scope**: Specify what will and will not be tested
3. **Tech Stack**: List and describe the technologies being used (from the provided tech stack) and how they impact testing
4. **Test Strategy**: Outline the overall approach to testing
5. **Test Types**: Identify the types of testing to be performed (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, security testing, etc.)
6. **Testing Tools and Frameworks**: Specify which testing tools and frameworks are appropriate for the given tech stack
7. **Test Environment**: Describe the environment setup needed based on the tech stack
8. **Test Cases/Scenarios**: Provide examples of key test cases or scenarios relevant to the project
9. **Entry and Exit Criteria**: Define when testing begins and when it's considered complete
10. **Risks and Mitigation**: Identify potential testing risks and how to address them
11. **Schedule/Timeline**: Provide a high-level testing timeline

When creating the test plan:
- Make sure to explicitly reference and integrate the tech stack throughout the plan, particularly in sections about testing tools, frameworks, and environment setup
- Tailor your recommendations to the specific technologies mentioned in the tech stack
- Consider technology-specific testing requirements (e.g., if React is in the stack, mention component testing; if there's a database, mention data integrity testing)
- Be specific and practical rather than generic

Write your complete test plan inside <test_plan> tags. The test plan should be well-organized, professional, and ready to be used by a development team.
