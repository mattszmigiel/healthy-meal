</tech-stack>

Conduct a critical but objective analysis of whether <tech-stack> adequately addresses the needs in $2. Consider the following questions:
1. Will the technology allow us to quickly deliver an MVP?
2. Will the solution be scalable as the project grows?
3. Will the cost of maintenance and development be acceptable?
4. Do we need such a complex solution?
5. Is there a simpler approach that would meet our requirements?
6. Will the technology allow us to ensure proper security?

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
