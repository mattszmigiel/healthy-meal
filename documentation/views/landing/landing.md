# Landing / Marketing Page

## View name
Landing

## Path
`/`

## Main purpose
- Present HealthyMeal's value proposition.
- Provide clear calls to action for new and returning users.

## Key information to display
- Product positioning: AI-powered dietary-aware recipe adaptation.
- Short explanation of how it works (set preferences → save recipes → adapt with AI).
- Primary actions: "Sign Up" and "Log In".

## Key view components
- Hero section (headline, subheadline, CTA buttons).
- Brief feature highlights (personal recipe library, AI modification, dietary profiles).

## UX, accessibility, and security considerations
- Clear heading hierarchy (e.g., `h1` for main value prop).
- Buttons with descriptive labels ("Sign Up for Free", "Log In").
- If user is already authenticated, immediately redirect to `/recipes` (avoids confusion).
- No sensitive data displayed; no account-specific content until authenticated.

## Related requirements
- Supports overall onboarding context for all auth and recipe-related US/FR.
